## Introduction
Artificial intelligence is rapidly gaining traction in the world of technology as a
powerful tool for data analysis, classification, and prediction. However, today’s
AI typically relies on a ”black box” model: a human observer can’t extrapolate
how the model makes its decisions through its operations alone. We rely on
quantifying the model through its output. Explainable AI (XAI) is a hot topic in AI
research today, endeavoring to make the inner workings of a ”black box” model
clearer by interpreting the results
